# C++ Practice

Welcome to my C++ practice repository! This project is a collection of code snippets, exercises, and projects that I'm using to improve my skills in C++ programming. 

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Practice fundamental and advanced C++ concepts.
- Solve coding exercises and challenges.
- Explore C++ libraries and frameworks.

## Contents

This repository may include:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Data structures and algorithms
- Standard Template Library (STL) usage
- Code for various C++ challenges and projects

## Getting Started

To run the code, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. You can compile each `.cpp` file individually:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
